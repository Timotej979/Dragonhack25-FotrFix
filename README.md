# 🛠️ [FotrFix] — DIY Home Repair, Rewired.

## ✨ The Problem

Broken faucet?  
Leaky toilet?  
Wobbly chair?  
And you, standing there, **Googling "how to fix sink"** — only to get a 45-minute YouTube vlog and **zero clue where to even start**.

The reality:  
**Young people today are less hands-on with home repairs than ever.**

- No time to dig through forums.
- No idea what tools they need.
- No confidence they're doing it right.

Home ownership and rentals are skyrocketing — but **DIY skills aren't**.
